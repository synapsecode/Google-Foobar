# Google-Foobar (2020-21) Curated Solutions

This is a repository that contains the python code for all the problems given to me in the Google Foobar challenge that I took part in, from December to January!
I could solve a few of them on my own but towards the end, it became very complicated and math heavy and I had to scout for solutions!
This repository contains my solutions and others' solutions for the problems!
